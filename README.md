# TextClassification-CNN
Generally, for NLP based problems, RNN based architectures such as LSTM/GRU’s are the widely preferred choices. On the other hand, CNNs and its variants are widely used for computer vision tasks. CNN’s are widely used for image classification tasks because of their ability to exploit local dependencies between pixels, i.e. understand the correlations between neighbouring pixels. However, they can be extended to NLP problems because of the fact that there are similar local dependencies found in linguistics (neighbouring words in sentences are dependent on each other). In this notebook, we will classify text documents across twenty different labels using a CNN architecture with 1D convolutional layers.   

# Objective
Classify text documents using a CNN architecture.

# Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries before running this project.

1. Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and scipy: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

# Getting Started
Start by downloading the project files and run the ".ipynb" file as a ipython-notebook (Jupyter notebook)

# Requirements
- Required libraries are:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - tensorflow
  - keras
  - scikit-learn
  - python >= 3.7
  - Check the notebooks for more details
